## Academic Background

Carlo Hofer is a final year PhD candidate in quantitative political science at the University of Warwick, and a post-doctoral fellow at QMUL. Carlo holds an MSc from the University of Venice as well as a BSc in Business and Computer Science from the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

## Dissertation

**Working title:** “Contextual effects: how changes in the neighbourhood affect individual behaviour”.
Carlo Hofer's thesis explores the relationship between neighbourhood characteristics and individual behaviour through a series of quasi-experimental studies. Carlo leverages newly released localised micro data on individual attitudes and behaviour to investigate a series of natural experiments. Carlo shows how treated subjects react to different types of shocks in their neighbourhood.
Carlo's dissertation is supervised by [Prof Vincenzo Bove](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/bove) and [Dr Andreas Murr](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/murr).
